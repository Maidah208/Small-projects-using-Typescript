This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The game is played between the user and the computer. The user selects their choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer makes its selection using a completely random process. This randomness is powered by TypeScript's Math.random() function, ensuring a fair and unpredictable opponent. The winner is determined based on the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.
