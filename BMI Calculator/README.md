** CLI BMI Calculator (TypeScript, Inquirer)**

This is a command-line interface (CLI) application that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided weight and height. Developed with TypeScript for strong typing and code maintainability, it utilizes Node.js for a JavaScript runtime environment. Inquirer facilitates user interaction for weight and height input. Additionally, the application rounds the BMI result to two decimal places for a clear presentation.
